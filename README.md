## Featured Projects

### 🚀 SMM Automation Panel (Private)
A high-capacity automation tool for managing and processing bulk social media interaction orders. Designed with scalability, job queues, and health monitoring in mind.

**Highlights**
- Process 10K+ orders/day using queuing and multiprocessing.
- Modular architecture for connecting to providers via API.
- Lightweight web dashboard for monitoring and reporting.
- Rate limiting and throttling to mimic natural traffic behavior.
- Built-in logging and monitoring system for real-time debugging.

**Tech Stack**: Python, **FastAPI** (Backend), Redis (Queue/Cache), HTML/CSS (UI), Docker (deployment).  
**Status**: Active – private internal version.

> Intended for research, load testing, and lawful automation purposes only.

### 🤖 DroneControlBot (Side Project – Private)
A Python-based simulator for multi-drone fleets with bulk command APIs; inspired by SMM-style scalability patterns.

**Features**
- Multi-drone coordination and synchronization.
- API for bulk operations and scenario testing.
- Structured logging and metrics for performance evaluation.
- Simulation environment for testing control strategies before real deployment.

**Tech Stack**: Python, FastAPI, WebSocket, structured logging, asyncio.
